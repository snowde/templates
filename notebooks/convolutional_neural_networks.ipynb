    "## Convolutional Neural Networks: MNIST classification with Keras\n",

    "(this is an annotated version of Keras's [example MNIST CNN code](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py))\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST classification task is a classic machine learning benchmark. The data includes 70,000 handwritten grayscale digits, and the task is to identify them. The digits run from 0 to 9 so this is a multiclass classification problem. In particular, there are 10 possible classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST classification task is sort of like a \"hello world\" for computer vision, so a solution can be implemented quickly with an off-the-shelf machine learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since convolutional neural networks have thusfar proven to be the best at computer vision tasks, we'll use the Keras library to implement a convolutional neural net as our solution. Keras provides a well-designed and readable API on top of both Theano and TensorFlow fast backends, so we'll be done in a surprisingly short amount of steps!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because MNIST is such a common task, the dataset is included with many machine learning libraries. With Keras, you can load the dataset with just a couple of lines:"
